                <h3> Dum Paneer Kali Mirch</h3>
                <p>A lovely take on the unusual paneer gravy: Small chunks of paneer cooked with cinnamon, fried onions,
                    black pepper, ginger, garlic and yogurt to make this gorgeous and fragrant curry. Paneer cubes are
                    cooked in flavourful spices in a dum or pressure, where steam can't release, making it a dish
                    bursting with aromatic flavours.</p>
